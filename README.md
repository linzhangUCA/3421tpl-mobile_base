# Assemble the Mobile Base

## Objectives
- Get a mobile base ready for later robot development.
- Practice basic robotic/engineering skills (taping, drilling, reading, assembling, etc.)
- Get familiar with Github usage.

## Tasks and Requirements
Edit [Student Work](#student-work) section to upload your homework.
- Upload pictures to [images](/images/) directory to demonstrate a completed mobile base.
   - **(25%)** Upload a [front_view.png](/images/front_view.png) picture of your robot.
   - **(25%)** Upload a [side_view.png](/images/side_view.png) picture.
   - **(25%)** Upload a [top_view.png](/images/top_view.png) picture.
 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Accepted image formats are `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.png`.
 
 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Edit file names in the [Proof of Completeness](#proof-of-completeness) section below so that the pictures can be previewed in the `README`.

- **(25%)** Let the mobile base running forward on the "rail" in classroom.
   Observe closely and answer the questions in the [**Analysis**](#analysis) section below.
 > [!CAUTION]
 > Answers will not be graded if the base failed to run on the "rail" with instructor's witness.
 > Instructor will designate a trial for student to analyze.

### Proof of Completeness
- **Front view**

- **Side view**
![side_view.png](/images/side_view.png)

- **Top view**
![top_view.png](/images/top_view.png)

### Analysis
- Was the mobile base going straight on the "rail"? Or was it leaning left, leaning right or having some other behaviors?
> Please fill your answer here.

- What cause the robot having above observed behavior in terms of **wheel speed**?
